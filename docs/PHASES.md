## Testing Strategy

### Automated Testing Approach
1. **Unit Tests (Vitest)**
   - Focus on business logic
   - Data calculations
   - Validation functions
   - Utility functions
   - LocalStorage operations

2. **Component Tests (React Testing Library)**
   - Basic component rendering
   - User interactions
   - Form submissions
   - Error states
   - Loading states

3. **Test Coverage Goals**
   - 80%+ coverage for utility functions
   - 70%+ coverage for components
   - Focus on critical paths

4. **Test Organization**
   ```
   src/
     __tests__/
       utils/         # Utility function tests
       components/    # Component tests
       hooks/         # Custom hook tests
   ```

5. **Continuous Integration**
   - Run tests before commits
   - Maintain test coverage thresholds

### What Not to Test
- Third-party library functionality
- Implementation details
- Purely visual components
- Browser-specific features

### Testing Tools
- Vitest for unit testing
- React Testing Library for component testing
- MSW for mocking API calls (if needed)
- Testing Library User Event for interaction testing

### General Testing Approach
- Test on both desktop and mobile devices
- Test with both mouse and keyboard navigation
- Verify all data persistence
- Check error handling
- Validate accessibility

### Test Data Suggestions
- Create at least 3 categories
- Add 5-10 households per category
- Use various guest counts (1-8)
- Create 2-3 tiers
- Make multiple scenarios

### Edge Cases to Test
- Very long household names
- Large guest counts
- Empty categories
- No tiers assigned
- Multiple browser tabs open
- Low storage conditions
- Slow network conditions

### Performance Testing
- Test with 100+ households
- Rapid category/tier switching
- Multiple scenario calculations
- Quick successive updates

### Browser Compatibility
Test on:
- Chrome
- Safari
- Firefox
- Mobile browsers

### Error Scenarios
- Invalid data in localStorage
- Network failures during CSV export
- Invalid user inputs
- Duplicate names
- Concurrent edits
