# Wedding Guest List App - Development Notes

## Design Principles

### 1. Prefer Simple Solutions
- Start with the simplest possible solution before adding complexity
- Question whether abstractions are truly needed
- Let the natural behavior of data structures work for you

### 2. State Management
- Use React's built-in state management when possible
- Immutable array operations (spread, map, filter) make state updates clean and predictable

### 3. Component Design
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Let data structures guide component design
- Avoid premature abstraction
