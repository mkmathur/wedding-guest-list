# Wedding Guest List App - UI Design Approaches

## Approach 1: Traditional Dashboard Layout
```
+------------------+------------------+
|     Header       |    Summary      |
+------------------+------------------+
|                  |                 |
|   Navigation     |    Content      |
|     Sidebar      |     Area        |
|                  |                 |
+------------------+-----------------+
```

**Pros:**
- Familiar layout for users
- Easy access to all features
- Good for desktop viewing
- Clear hierarchy

**Cons:**
- Less optimal for mobile
- May feel too "corporate"
- Requires more clicks to navigate
- Wastes space on wider screens

## Approach 2: Tab-Based Navigation
```
+----------------------------------+
|     Header + Total Count         |
+----------------------------------+
| [Categories][Households][Scenarios]
+----------------------------------+
|                                  |
|          Content Area            |
|                                  |
+----------------------------------+
```

**Pros:**
- Simple, focused interface
- Works well on mobile
- Clear context for current task
- Minimal learning curve

**Cons:**
- Limited view of overall data
- More switching between views
- Less efficient for power users
- May feel too simple

## Approach 3: Split View (Recommended)
```
+----------------------------------+
|              Header              |
+----------------------------------+
|        Quick Actions Bar         |
+---------------+----------------+-+
| Categories &  |   Household    |S|
|    Tiers     |     List       |c|
|              |                 |e|
|   [Drag to   |   Grouped by   |n|
|    filter]   |   Category     |a|
|              |                 |r|
|              |   Running      |i|
|              |   Totals       |o|
+---------------+-----------------+s
```

**Pros:**
- Efficient workflow
- Drag & drop filtering
- Always visible totals
- Good use of screen space
- Scales well from small to large lists
- Combines browsing and filtering

**Cons:**
- More complex initial learning curve
- Requires careful mobile adaptation
- More complex to implement

## Approach 4: Wizard-Style
```
[Step 1] → [Step 2] → [Step 3] → [Step 4]
+----------------------------------+
|         Current Step             |
|                                 |
|         Step Content            |
|                                 |
+----------------------------------+
```

**Pros:**
- Very guided experience
- Good for initial setup
- Clear progression
- Simple to understand

**Cons:**
- Inefficient for quick updates
- Too linear for regular use
- Not great for overview
- May feel restrictive

## Recommendation: Split View (Approach 3)

I recommend the Split View approach for the following reasons:

### 1. Efficiency
- Categories and tiers are always visible
- Drag and drop filtering is intuitive
- Quick access to all main functions
- Minimal clicking required

### 2. Information Density
- Makes good use of available space
- Shows important information at all times
- Provides context for decisions
- Running totals always visible

### 3. Flexibility
- Works well for both small and large lists
- Adapts to different screen sizes
- Supports both basic and power users
- Can be simplified for mobile

### 4. User Experience
- Natural workflow from left to right
- Intuitive filtering via drag and drop
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Immediate feedback on changes

## Mobile Adaptation of Split View
