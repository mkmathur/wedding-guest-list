# Wedding Guest List App - UI Design Approaches

## Design Principles

### 1. Simplicity First
- Start with core functionality
- Minimal UI elements
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Focus on essential features

### 2. Progressive Enhancement
- Basic functionality first
- Add features incrementally
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Keep core experience solid

### 3. User Flow
- Clear navigation paths
- Predictable interactions
- Consistent state management
- Intuitive transitions

## Event Creation Design

### Core Functionality (Phase 1)
1. **Event Management**
   - Create new events
   - Edit existing events
   - Delete events
   - View event list

2. **Guest Selection**

   - Guest count calculations
   - Data persistence

### Interface States

1. **List View**
   - Display saved events
   - Show guest counts
   - Provide edit/delete actions
   - Quick access to create new
