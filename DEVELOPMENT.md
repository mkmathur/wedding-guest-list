# Wedding Guest List App - Development Notes

## Design Principles

### 1. Prefer Simple Solutions
- Start with the simplest possible solution before adding complexity
- Question whether abstractions are truly needed
- Let the natural behavior of data structures work for you

### 2. State Management
- Use React's built-in state management when possible
- Array position can be a simple and effective way to manage order
- Immutable array operations (spread, map, filter) make state updates clean and predictable

### 3. Component Design
- Keep components focused on a single responsibility
- Let data structures guide component design
- Avoid premature abstraction

## Lessons Learned

### Tier Management
Initially, we overcomplicated tier ordering by:
1. Adding an explicit `order` property to each tier
2. Managing order values separately from array position
3. Creating complex logic to maintain order consistency

The simpler solution that worked better:
1. Use array position to determine order
2. Simple array operations for all updates:
   - Add: append to array
   - Delete: filter from array
   - Move: swap array elements
   - Edit: map over array
3. No need for additional state or complex calculations

Benefits of this approach:
- More predictable behavior
- Easier to maintain
- Fewer edge cases
- Simpler testing
- Better performance (fewer calculations)

### React Best Practices Applied
1. Single Responsibility Principle
   - Each component has one clear purpose
   - State management is straightforward
   - Operations are simple and focused

2. Immutable State Updates
   - Always create new arrays for updates
   - Use spread operator and array methods
   - Maintain referential integrity

3. Props Design
   - Clear interface between components
   - Minimal prop drilling
   - Event handlers follow consistent patterns

## Future Considerations

### Potential Improvements
1. Consider drag-and-drop reordering for better UX
2. Add undo/redo functionality
3. Implement bulk operations for tiers

### Scaling Considerations
1. Current array-based ordering works well for small to medium lists
2. If list size grows significantly, consider:
   - Virtualization for performance
   - Pagination or infinite scroll
   - Chunked updates for large operations
